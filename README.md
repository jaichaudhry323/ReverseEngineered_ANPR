# ReverseEngineered_ANPR

Original Version can be found here: https://github.com/longphungtuan94/ALPR_System

`Combined_Code_For_Video.ipynb` mostly contains the original version only but with few comments for better understanding

Then there's `Segmented Code for Analysis.ipynb` file which gives deep insight as to how the original code works (This is the reverse engineering part)

Reverse Engineering was done to get insight as to how to use multiple opencv functions for getting meaningful results with good accuracy
(Believe me, this took quite some time, wasn't a piece of cake work)

Learnings: Now am much more confident in OpenCV than I was before I reverse engineered this project !!
